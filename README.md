# Tracking and counting vehicles

## Problem Definition:
In this project we will try to detect, track and find the number of vehicles
has passed on a specific lane.

For this purpose, we have to estimate the
background and extract the foreground images. Subsequently, an algorithm
needs to be developed to count a number of vehicles.
## Usage:

Download the [M6 Motorway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNCJQkvALVc) video and rename it as `video.mp4` and move it into the same directory with the source code and run as `python3 counter.py`
